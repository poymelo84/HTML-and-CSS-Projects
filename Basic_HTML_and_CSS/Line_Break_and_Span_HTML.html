	</body>
	<p>
	Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.<br>
<br>Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.<br>
<br>Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.<br>
<br>Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.<br>
