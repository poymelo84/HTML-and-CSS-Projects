# HTML and CSS Projects
This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.

Projects:

> Space Station Site

> Movie Theater Site

> One Page Site

Space Station Site - This page is an example home page for a space travel company. 
It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers and a form.

Movie Theater Site - This page is an example home page for a Movie theatre that is
styled using Bootsrap 4. It contains many bootstrap components including but not 
limited to a navbar, a jumbotron, form, cards and dropdowns.

One Page Site - This page is made from srcatch as a way to practice writing HTML codes
with CSS.
