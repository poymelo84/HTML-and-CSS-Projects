# HTML and CSS Projects
This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.

Projects:

> Space Station Site

> Movie Theater Site

> One Page Site

> Index (Modified Space Station site

> Portfolio

Space Station Site - This is an example home page for a potential space travel company. 
It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers with some animation and a form.

Movie Theater Site - This page is an example home page for a Movie theatre that is
styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many bootstrap components including but not 
limited to a navbar, a jumbotron, form, cards and dropdowns.

One Page Site - This page is made from srcatch as a way to practice writing HTML codes
with CSS. In this particular site, I wrote an HTML code about cars and styled it with
some basic CSS.

Index - This particular webpage is a modification of the Space Station site. I replaced the main
photo and gallery photos and included some relevant texts.

Portfolio - This is a modified Portfolio site page that is currently live at 
https://poymelo84.github.io/Portfolio/ and contains a navbar, columns, links and
a form and is heavily styled with CSS.
